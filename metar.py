metar.py â€“ Streamlined METAR LED Display with Legend
-----------------------------------------------------
This script reads a list of airport codes from a file named "airports",
fetches the latest METAR weather data from aviationweather.gov for these airports,
parses the flight category, and updates a NeoPixel LED strip accordingly.

It reserves the first 8 LEDs as a legend:
  LED 0: VFR      (Green)
  LED 1: MVFR     (Blue)
  LED 2: IFR      (Red)
  LED 3: LIFR     (Magenta)
  LED 4: LIGHTNING (White)
  LED 5: WINDY    (Orange)
  LED 6: HIGH WINDS (Yellow)
  LED 7: UNKNOWN  (Gray)

The remaining LEDs display weather for each airport.

Before running, install dependencies:
    sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel
